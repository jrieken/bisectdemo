This extension is annoying and only serves as a sample to try out the extension bisect feature. 

* install this extension
* type the word "bisect" or put the cursor on that word
* your cursor is being reset to the document start ðŸ¤¬ 
* select "F1 > Start Extension Bisect" with this annoyance in mind
